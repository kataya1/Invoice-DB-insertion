1- make database

    sudo su - postgres
    createdb shellscriptinglab
    psql 
    \c shellscriptinglab
    \i <path>/setup.sql

2- creating dummy txt

    1- touch invoice invoice_details
    2- chmod o+w invoice invoice_details

3- create scripts

    1- cd ~
    2- mkdir shell_scripting_lab1
    3- touch invoice_validation.sh invoice_detailes_validation.sh steps.txt
    4- chmod a+wx invoice_validation.sh invoice_detailes_validation.sh

    5- touch dbinsert_into_invoice.sh    
    6- touch dbinsert_into_invoice_detailes.sh
    7- chmod o+wx dbinsert_into_invoice.sh dbinsert_into_invoice_detailes.sh

    8- make .pgpass in ~ directory # echo "localhost:5432:shellscriptinglab:postgres:<passwd>" > ~/.pgpass
    9- chmod 0600 .pgpass

4- run scripts in order
    
    1- ./invoice_validation.sh invoice
    2- ./invoice_detailes_validation.sh invoice_details

    #  the two scripts will create new files valid_invoice and valid_invoice_detailes
    #  run the scripts dbinsert_into_invoice.sh and  dbinsert_into_invoice_details.sh to insert into database 

    1- ./dbinsert_into_invoice valid_invoice
    2- ./dbinsert_into_invoice_details valid_invoice_detailes

5- reserves
    #CAN'T CHECK UNIQUENESS OF AN ID it involves a database request and response on each line (that's authentication vs validation)
    #the better way to do it is to leave the database to handle it
    #it's better not to check it on file either if an invaliid entry stops a valid entry with the same 
    id from going to the valid_invoice file (we can fix this but there is no difference between including 
    2 valid invoice with same id   and  inserting into the database when the id already exists)
